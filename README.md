After clicking Generate Password, the user is prompted to choose from the following password criteria:

* Length (must be between 8 and 128 characters)

* Character type:

  * Special characters ([see examples](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters))

  * Numeric characters

  * Lowercase characters

  * Uppercase characters

The application validates user input and ensures that at least one character type is selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the user is presented with a password matching the answered prompts. The password is displayed on the page.

The user has the option to click a button to copy the password to the clipboard.

The application has a clean user interface and is responsive, meaning it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
